# Well Hello There
#### Skills: How to: Not be a noob

#### By: Sabeel Mansuri and Mark Chernyshev

## The Big Picture

These activities are designed for people with zero to some programming experience and zero to some Bioinformatics experience. We want to give Bioinformatics freshmen some of the confidence, skills, and resources needed to apply to labs/internships and to give non-Bioinformaticians a handle on how the field works. 

## Getting Started

# TODO: 
Figure out how to utilize EC2 and create a disk image


Fire up that computer! If you're asked *Windows* or *Linux*, choose **LINUX**. Linux based systems are usually what you're 
going to use in bioinformatics.

## Task 1

Log in with your ???????????TODO????????? account. This (might be) your first time using a Linux device. Don't worry, they'e
super easy to use (expecially for what we're doing!).

## Task 2

Open the terminal. Right click anywhere on the desktop and select "Open Terminal".

## Task 3

Discover your identity. Type `whoami` into the window that just opened up and hit `enter`. And just like that you're talking
with your computer, you bioinformatician, you.
