# Well Hello There
#### Skills: How to: Not be a noob

## The Big Picture

To gain a working knowledge of bioinformatics. To be better prepared to interview for/work in a lab.

## Getting Started

Fire up that computer! If you're asked *Windows* or *Linux*, choose **LINUX**. Linux based systems are usually what you're 
going to use in bioinformatics.

## Task 1

Log in with your ???????????TODO????????? account. This (might be) your first time using a Linux device. Don't worry, they'e
super easy to use (expecially for what we're doing!).

## Task 2

Open the terminal. Right click anywhere on the desktop and select "Open Terminal".

## Task 3

Discover your identity. Type `whoami` into the window that just opened up and hit `enter`. And just like that you're talking
with your computer, you bioinformatician, you.
