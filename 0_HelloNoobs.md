# Well Hello There
#### Skills: How to: Not be a noob

## The Big Picture

These activities are designed for people with zero to some programming experience and zero to some Bioinformatics experience. We want to give Bioinformatics freshmen some of the confidence, skills, and resources needed to apply to labs/internships and to give non-Bioinformaticians a handle on how the field works. 

## Getting Started

Fire up that computer! If you're asked *Windows* or *Linux*, choose **LINUX**. Linux based systems are usually what you're 
going to use in bioinformatics.

## Task 1: Make EC2 do your work!

This (might be) your first time using a Linux device. Don't worry, they'e
super easy to use (expecially for what we're doing!).

In order to make sure everyone is on the same page at all times, we are going to have everyone use the same computer: a giant computer in the sky, called the Amazon Elastic Cloud (EC2). Click [here](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup?nc2=h_ct&redirect_url=https%3A%2F%2Faws.amazon.com%2Fregistration-confirmation#/start) and fill out the form to create your own AWS account using your @ucsd.edu email. Once you have confirmed your email, sign into your AWS account and look at all the great resources at your fingertips. Click on All Services->Compute->EC2 and notice that it will give you a page asking you to wait. EC2 accounts take some time to set up(mine took 4 hours). Unfortunately, it looks like we'll have to come back to setting up our computers next time :'( . Trust me, this is the most time consuming step.

## Task 2

Open the terminal. Right click anywhere on the desktop and select "Open Terminal".

## Task 3

Discover your identity. Type `whoami` into the window that just opened up and hit `enter`. And just like that you're talking
with your computer, you bioinformatician, you.
