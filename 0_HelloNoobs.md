# Well Hello There
#### Skills: How to: Not be a noob

## The Big Picture

These activities are designed for people with zero to some programming experience and zero to some Bioinformatics experience. We want to give Bioinformatics freshmen some of the confidence, skills, and resources needed to apply to labs/internships and to give non-Bioinformaticians a handle on how the field works. 

## Getting a Computer Set Up

Fire up that computer! If you're asked *Windows* or *Linux*, choose **LINUX**. Linux based systems are usually what you're 
going to use in bioinformatics.

## Task 1: Make EC2 do your work!

This (might be) your first time using a Linux device. Don't worry, they'e
super easy to use (expecially for what we're doing!). Trust us, you do not want to have everyone in the room using their own computers. It gets messy. 

In order to make sure everyone is on the same page at all times, we are going to have everyone use the same computer: a giant computer in the sky, called the Amazon Elastic Cloud (EC2). We have an Ubuntu instance large enough to handle everyone's activities running in EC2, now we just need to have everyone make accounts. Please click here[] and enter your name and UCSD user name. I will create an account for everyone - your username will be your UCSD username. 

***Secure Shell(ssh):*** a protocol which creates a secure channel for two computers to communicate even over an unsecured network. This is how we will connect to EC2. 

**How to prepare for ssh:**


**Windows:** I do not like Windows terminals, you do not like Windows terminals, no one likes Windows terminals. Go to [this](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html) website and download Putty. A GUI should appear to guide you through the installation. 

**Mac or Linux:** No preparation necessary, since you already have a native ssh client. 

While I am busy creating your accounts, my partner will introduce some biology you should know in order to do bioinformatics.

## Task 2: Learn some biology


## Task 3: Explore your EC2

Discover your identity. Type `whoami` into the window that just opened up and hit `enter`. And just like that you're talking
with your computer, you bioinformatician, you.
