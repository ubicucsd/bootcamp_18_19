####Skill: Command Line Use

##Why Though? 

Bioinformaticians should be friendly with the command line, since it is the fastest way to deal with their XXL sized files and much of the software in the field has no GUI. 

##What is this?

Anytime you need a refresh on what a command does, type the command line with the --help option like so: ```ls --help```. 

##Navigation and Manipulation

**cd**(change directory) hopefully this is familiar. Type cd followed by the directory's path to navigate a terminal to that directory. ```.``` is current directory and ```..``` is the parent of the current directory. 

**ls**(list files) prints out the contents of a directory. There are tons of options for this command - my favorite is ```ls -lah```

**cp**(copy) copies the file in the first argument to the directory in the second argument

**rm**(remove) deletes a file. 

**mv**(move) like copy, but the original file disappears. 

**grep** looks for patterns in the text you feed it and returns the matches it finds. It can look through text files, the list of files in a repository and much much more. 

**wc**(word count) counts things like lines, words, and characters

##Execution

**/bin**(binaries) contains your executable files and shells. The computer has a list of folders it searches through to find executables when you type a command and the /bin directory is one of them. When you download software, you should place the executable file or a symbolic link into the /bin directory.
