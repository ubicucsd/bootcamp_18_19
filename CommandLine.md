####Skill: Command Line Use

##Why Though? 

Quoting the Bioinformatics professor whose lab I work with: "ja, true, you need that shit."

It is the fastest way to deal with XXL sized files, much of the software in Bionformatics has no GUI, and any programmer should have a healthy relationship with their system. 

##What is this?

Anytime you need a refresh on what a command does, type the command line with the --help option like so: ```ls --help```. 

##Navigation and Manipulation

**cd**(change directory) hopefully this is familiar. Type cd followed by the directory's path to navigate a terminal to that directory. ```.``` is current directory and ```..``` is the parent of the current directory. 

**ls**(list files) prints out the contents of a directory. There are tons of options for this command - my favorite is ```ls -lah```

**cp**(copy) copies the file in the first argument to the directory in the second argument

**rm**(remove) deletes a file. 

**mv**(move) like copy, but the original file disappears. 

**grep** looks for patterns in the text you feed it and returns the matches it finds. It can look through text files, the list of files in a repository and much much more. 

**wc**(word count) counts things like lines, words, and characters

##Execution

**/bin**(binaries) contains your executable files and shells. The computer has a list of folders it searches through to find executables when you type a command and the /bin directory is one of them. When you download software, you should place the executable file or a symbolic link into the /bin directory.
