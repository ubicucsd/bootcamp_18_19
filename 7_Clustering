# Clustering

#### Skills: Even more Python and hopefully an understanding of why clustering is useful in bioinformatics

1. General Description of clustering and why it is important in bioinformatics

### General Factoids

*Clustering:* The process of partitioning a dataset into groups based on shared unkown characteristics. 

Where does it apply to bioinformatics? Clustering, the same as most things in bioinformatics, applies to 

2. Get an example dataset and have them learn a few different methods with sklearn on python


3. Example from Ben lab + an article example or something

4. Challenge exercise can be a 181-like assignment to implement a type of clustering (such as soft clustering)
