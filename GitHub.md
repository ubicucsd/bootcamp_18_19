# Good ol' Git(Hub)
#### Skills: Version Control, Collaborative Coding

## The Big Picture

All of the lectures so far have been on GitHub, but what even is GitHub? Although you've used GitHub primarily for getting 
assignments, that isn't GitHub's intended use (though it does do a good job of holding our material!). GitHub is primarly 
focused on allowing one or more users to store and collaborate on projects. There's two main parts to how GitHub does this: 
1. version control ("Git")   
2. collaborative coding ("Hub")

Today, we explore the hidden power of GitHub.

## Getting Started

Create a new directory for this week. Enter that directory. Visit www.github.com. Sign up for a GitHub account using your UCSD email (even if you already have one!).

Tip: Use an all-lowercase username. There's only a few places where this matters, but it'll just make your life easier.
