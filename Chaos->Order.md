# How to Convert the Chaos of Sequencing Useful Information

## Question: 
You have sequenced DNA from two species of E. Coli. How do you find the single nucleotide polymorphisms between the two species? 

#### Skills: 
Learn basic biological data formats, alignment, and SNP detection. 

***PLEASE NOTE:*** This lesson is meant to give you a feel for what biological data looks like. There is little benefit to memorizing formats and there is no point in making your own formats or reinventing ways to interact with these formats(unless you know *exactly* what you are doing). As that one saying goes, "this is the worst possible way to store this data, except for all the other ways."

## Sequencing and Fastq/Fasta

To understand how DNA and RNA are represented in a computer, we must understand how information on DNA and RNA are gathered in the wet lab. There are many ways to sequence DNA and RNA, but here I will discuss only three due to effectivenes, relevance, and personal bias: Sanger, Illumina, and PacBio.

**Sanger:** 

# TODO: 
Create a lesson on alignment for Sanger(keep it short, since it's old) and focus on Illumina+Pacbio(read lengths, error rates, bridges)

### Basics: Fastq, Fasta

**Fastq** is one of the more plain formats and is typically what you would see come out of a sequencer
