# Let's Talk Snake
#### Skill: Python

## The Big Picture

The command line can only take you so far when you're working with bioinformatic data. You'll often want to do more than the command line easily allows you to, which means it's time to write some code. This week, we're going to be doing that via a popular scripting language called Python. Let's get started.

(Side note: If you know a bit about Python, you'll know that there are two commonly used versions: python2 and python3. **They are VERY similar.** If you spend enough time doing bioinformatics, you're going to run into programs written for both versions, so being familiar with both is important. For this lesson, however, we're going to be using python2 because... well... we are.)

## Getting Started

Python *should* already be installed on your workstations. Let's make sure: Type the following on the command line:
```shell
python
```
You should see something that looks like this (note that this was done on a Mac, so your output might differ slightly):
```shell
Python 2.7.10 (default, Oct  6 2017, 22:29:07) 
[GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 9.0.0 (clang-900.0.31)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> 
```

If you do not see this, let one of us know. If you do, you're ready to roll.

## How to Python

Before we get into the bioinformatics of Python, we're going to take a quick look at how Python is written.
